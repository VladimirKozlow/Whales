CS 230 Whale Recognition Project based on the [Humback Whale Identification Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/humpback-whale-identification) Kaggle competition.

## Getting Started
This repository contains two Python 3 notebooks and a PDF document describing our work:
* CS 230 Data Preprocessing.ipynb takes care of the data preprocessing as described in the PDF document
* CS 230 Project, Model 1.ipynb is our first Whale classification implementation using a CNN architecture based using Keras backend
* CS_230_project_milestone.pdf is the pdf file describing our goal, method and preliminary results
